# Marketplace UI Finalization

This feature focuses on integrating the newly created `ServiceCard.tsx` component into the `MarketPage.tsx`, ensuring all functionalities like service display, selection, and installation initiation are working correctly. It also includes thorough testing of the marketplace UI.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Task 1: Integrate `ServiceCard.tsx` into `MarketPage.tsx` `new-feat`
  - [x] Sub-task 1.1: Modify `MarketPage.tsx` (via `ServiceMarketplace.tsx`) to import and use `ServiceCard.tsx` for rendering search results from `marketStore`.
  - [x] Sub-task 1.2: Ensure `service` prop is correctly passed to each `ServiceCard.tsx`.
  - [x] Sub-task 1.3: Wire up `onSelect` prop of `ServiceCard.tsx` in `MarketPage.tsx` (via `ServiceMarketplace.tsx`) to navigate to service detail page (handled by `onSelectService` calling `store.selectService`).
  - [x] Sub-task 1.4: Wire up `onInstall` prop of `ServiceCard.tsx` in `MarketPage.tsx` (via `ServiceMarketplace.tsx`) to call the `installService` action in `marketStore`.

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Task 2: Comprehensive UI Testing and Refinement for Marketplace `new-feat`
  - [ ] Sub-task 2.1: Test search functionality with various search terms (including empty and non-matching) on both "Discover" and "Installed" tabs.
  - [x] Sub-task 2.2: Verify accurate display of all information on `ServiceCard.tsx` (name, version, author, source/package_manager, GitHub link, npm score/GitHub stars, install button) for different services (NPM, PyPI if distinguishable). **Ensure "(npm score)" text is removed if npm score is displayed.** (Code change done, pending verification)
  - [ ] Sub-task 2.3: Confirm correct behavior of the install button (initiates installation, updates status, reflects installed state). Check if `installService` store action correctly handles installation when triggered from a card (it currently relies on `selectedService` being set).
  - [ ] Sub-task 2.4: Test navigation to service detail page upon card selection.
  - [ ] Sub-task 2.5: Check UI responsiveness with multiple cards.
  - [ ] Sub-task 2.6: Ensure graceful handling if some data fields (e.g., `github_stars`, `npmScore`, `homepageUrl`) are missing for a service.
  - [x] **Sub-task 2.7: Modify search logic to append " mcp" to non-empty search terms and test.** `ref-func` (Code change done, pending verification)

## Future Tasks

## Implementation Plan

### Task 1: Integrate `ServiceCard.tsx`
The `MarketPage.tsx` component, which currently fetches and displays service search results (likely using a direct rendering method or an older card component), needs to be updated.
- It should map over the `searchResults` or `installedServices` from `marketStore`.
- For each service object, it should render a `ServiceCard.tsx` component, passing the service data.
- Handlers for `onSelect` and `onInstall` need to be implemented in `MarketPage.tsx`.
  - `onSelect` will likely use `navigate` from `react-router-dom` to go to a detail page. The route for service details needs to be confirmed (e.g., `/market/service/:serviceId`).
  - `onInstall` will call `marketStore.installService(serviceId, version, packageManager, userProvidedEnvVars)`. The necessary parameters (`serviceId`, `version`, `packageManager`) should be available from the `service` object. `userProvidedEnvVars` might be collected via a modal before calling install, or initially passed as empty. For now, assume it might be empty or a placeholder.

### Task 2: UI Testing
Manual testing based on the sub-tasks. Pay attention to how different data scenarios from the backend are rendered on the card.
Verify that the `is_installed` status correctly affects the install button (e.g., shows "Installed" or "Open" instead of "Install"). The `ServiceType` has `is_installed`, and `ServiceCard.tsx` should already be designed to handle this.
